    "## 💬👥🤖 Project 1: Customer Service System\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**:\n",
    "Build an LLM-powered customer service assistant that can understand user intent, answer FAQs, provide product information, and allow users to place orders by collecting their contact information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Query Handling**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accept user queries via a web interface (Gradio or Streamlit).\n",
    "- Support dynamic responses from the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Knowledge Base**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- FAQ dataset (common support questions).\n",
    "- JSON file containing product information (title, description, price, availability, category, etc.).\n",
    "- Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to answer queries using the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **LLM Integration**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use OpenAI, HuggingFace, or another LLM to interpret queries and generate natural language responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent Capabilities**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Answer FAQs**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- “When is the shop open?”\n",
    "- “How can I return a product?”\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Answer product-related queries**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "- “What is the cheapest product you have?”\n",
    "- “How many of product X are available?”\n",
    "- “Is product Y suitable for outdoor use?”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Order Placement**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user wants to order a product, the system asks for:\n",
    "- Name\n",
    "- Email\n",
    "- Phone number\n",
    "- Selected product(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "Save this order information in a JSON or database file.\n",
    "Confirm the order to the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Understand user intent**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ask clarifying questions for complex queries:\n",
    "    - “Are you looking for a budget-friendly option or premium products?”\n",
    "    - “Do you want electronics or home appliances?”\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optional Advanced Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multi-turn conversation memory.\n",
    "- Query categorization: billing, technical support, FAQ, product questions, suggestions.\n",
    "- Web scraping for live product updates.\n",
    "- Analytics: track popular products and common questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "User types a query:\n",
    "“I want to buy the cheapest laptop you have.”\n",
    "\n",
    "System searches the product JSON.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM generates a response:\n",
    "“The cheapest laptop available is the X1000, priced at $450. Would you like to place an order?”\n",
    "\n",
    "If the user confirms, the system asks for contact details:\n",
    "Name, email, phone number\n",
    "\n",
    "System saves the order in orders.json (or a small database) and confirms:\n",
    "“Thank you! Your order for the X1000 laptop has been received. We will contact you at your email or phone for confirmation.”"
